AUDIOBOOK ENGINEERING RATE CALCULATOR - SHARING GUIDE
====================================================

This calculator helps estimate rates for audiobook engineering work.

OPTION 1: ALWAYS-ACTIVE LINK (RECOMMENDED)
------------------------------------------
Host this on GitHub Pages for a permanent link that always works:

1. Go to github.com and create a free account (if you don't have one)
2. Create a new repository called "audiobook-calculator"
3. Upload the "index.html" file
4. Go to Settings > Pages
5. Select "Deploy from a branch" and choose "main"
6. Your calculator will be available at: 
   https://[your-username].github.io/audiobook-calculator

OPTION 2: SIMPLE LOCAL SHARING
-------------------------------
Share the calculator files directly with coworkers:

FOR WINDOWS USERS:
1. Send them the folder containing:
   - index.html
   - launch-calculator.bat
2. Tell them to double-click "launch-calculator.bat"
3. The calculator opens in their browser automatically!

FOR MAC USERS:
1. Send them the folder containing:
   - index.html  
   - launch-calculator.command
2. Tell them to double-click "launch-calculator.command"
3. The calculator opens in their browser automatically!

SUPER SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUR COWORKERS:
---------------------------------------------
"Just double-click the file that says 'launch-calculator' and the calculator will open in your web browser. That's it!"

ALTERNATIVE: EMAIL METHOD
-------------------------
You can also just email them the "index.html" file and tell them:
"Save this file to your computer, then double-click it to open the calculator."

The calculator works completely offline - no internet required once they have the file!
